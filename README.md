the assignment was completed as good as possible with much time dedicated for reviewing the sessions and course materials as recordings, slides and solved examples.
actually, despite that it was a bit tricky so i seeked a a help using the slack channels and this is what happened thankfully 
i got guideliness from AskBSC Channel for completing the last part of the assignment 
one of my colleagues also helped by providing his feedback over my code and exchanging the openions and codes as well over slack, his name : Mushfiqur Rahman, there is no prior relationship or personal knowledge before the courese
